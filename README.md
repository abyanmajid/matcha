# Matcha ðŸŒ¿

An ergonomic, schema-first REST framework built on top of the [Chi](https://github.dev/go-chi/chi) Golang multiplexer.

**Schema-first philosophy:** Matcha encourages you to define a schema that specifies the request and response payload types (DTOs), and automatically generates an OpenAPI specification for your routes before you implement the handler logic.

Being a direct fork, Matcha ([matcha](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha)) inherits all functionalities of [Chi](https://github.dev/go-chi/chi). Apart from that, however, Matcha also wires together much of the tooling you might need to create a production-ready server: OpenAPI specification and API reference ([matcha/openapi](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha/tree/master/openapi)), input validation ([matcha/validation](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha/tree/master/validation)), in-memory and KV-store ratelimit ([matcha/cache](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha/tree/master/cache)), SMTP emails ([matcha/email](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha/tree/master/email)), JSON Web Tokens ([matcha/jwt](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha/tree/master/jwt))
