# Matcha ðŸŒ¿

Matcha is an schema-first REST framework built on top of the [Chi](https://github.dev/go-chi/chi) Golang multiplexer. It encourages you to define a Matcha schema that specifies the request and response payload types (DTOs), and automatically generates an OpenAPI specification for your routes before you implement the handler logic.

Being a direct fork, Matcha ([matcha](#)) inherits all functionalities of [Chi](https://github.dev/go-chi/chi). Apart from that, however, Matcha also wires together much of the tooling you might need to create a production-ready server: OpenAPI documentation ([matcha/openapi](#)), API reference ([matcha/scalar](#)), input validation ([matcha/validation](#)), in-memory and KV-store ratelimit ([matcha/cache](#)), SMTP emails ([matcha/emails](#)), JSON Web Tokens ([matcha/jwt](#))
