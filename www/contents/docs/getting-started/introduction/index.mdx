description: This section provides an overview of Matcha.

**Matcha** is an schema-first Golang REST framework built on top of the [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router, where *"schema-first"* here implies:

1. Your HTTP handlers must be two types via generics. One for the request and one for the response.
2. Your HTTP routes must have an OpenAPI specification before you can register them as a resource.
